			<h3>Before the Fires</h3>

			On the 8th of January, an <span class="hook" data-ref="1.4">electrical storm</span> passed over the area. <span class="line closed" id="1.4">The storm was accompanied by <span class="hook" data-ref="1.3.1">strong winds</span><span class="line closed" id="1.3.1">; northwesterly winds 30- 35 km/h, with gusts reaching 45 km/h as the decaying showers passed</span>.</span> This ignited <span class="hook" data-ref="1.5">fires</span> in the mountains. <span class="line closed" id="1.5">These fires were referred to as the, Bendora, Stockyard Spur, Gingera, <span class="hook" data-ref="1.5.1">McIntyre Hut, and Mount Morgan fires</span>. <span class="line closed" id="1.5.1">McIntyre Hut and Mount Morgan were in NSW with others reported at Yarrangobilly and Broken Cart.</span></span>

            </p>
			
			<h3>The Fires Spread</h3>
			<p>
				The fires were first noticed by on-duty fire tower observers. They sent word and emergency services <span class="hook" data-ref="2.1">responded</span>. <span class="line closed" id="2.1"><span class="hook" data-ref="2.1.1">Firebird 7</span><span class="line closed" id="2.1.1">, the ACT Bushfire Service’s contracted light helicopter,</span> was sent in for reconnaissance. <img src="images/firebird7.jpg" >And two <span class="hook" data-ref="2.1.2">response teams</span><span class="line closed" id="2.1.2">, who were on standby because of the harsh conditions,</span> went into the mountains. They arrived at 6pm. Firebird 7 gave their <span class="hook" data-ref="2.1.3">situation report</span><span class="line closed" id="2.1.3">: “Okay this fire’s doing about 100 metres from the Warks Road uphill. It’s drawing into itself, it’s not moving very fast ... we can access the eastern side of it from Warks Road with tankers and light units but we will need rake hoe lines around the top section and water bombing on the top section as well the fuel loads fairly heavy from wet sclerophyll forest”</span>.
				<br>
				<br>
				</span> However, efforts to fight the fires halted overnight due to <span class="hook" data-ref="2.2">bad conditions</span>. <span class="line closed" id="2.2">The terrain was unfamiliar and unkempt, with fallen trees and debris blocking passageway, and the fire crews were not fully stocked for a night of fighting without assistance. The Duty Coordinator at ESB headquarters <span class="hook" data-ref="2.2.1">told</span> everybody to come home<span class="line closed" id="2.2.1">: “Thanks for your attendance at this incident. You may return to your area and crews will be returning in the morning”</span>.</span>

        On thursday the 9th, crews were back to <span class="hook" data-ref="2.3">work</span><span class="line closed" id="2.3">, arriving at the staging area at 6:00 am</span>. The conditions were <span class="hook" data-ref="2.4">fine</span>, and would stay that way for a week. <span class="line closed" id="2.4">With winds around 10-30 km/h, heading south-west, and a fire danger index from 14 to 19.</span> During the first week hundreds of <span class="hook" data-ref="2.5">personnel</span> and <span class="hook" data-ref="2.6">equipment</span> were assigned to the fires. <span class="line closed" id="2.5">By friday it was over 100 and by the following thursday, it was 250 <span class="hook" data-ref="2.5.1">people</span>. <span class="line closed" id="2.5.1">The NSW rural fire service, ACT bushfire service, ACT fire brigade, and various others contributed people from as far as Lismore.</span></span> <span class="line closed" id="2.6">The Snowy Hydro Southcare helicopter was one of the first helicopters employed in water bombing, later complemented by <span class="hook" data-ref="2.6.1">4 navy helicopters</span><span class="line closed" id="2.6.1">, 2 Navy Seahawks for water bombing and 2 Navy Squirrels for reconnaissance, arriving on monday the 13th</span>. Bulldozers were employed to create <span class="hook" data-ref="2.6.2">fire breaks</span><span class="line closed" id="2.6.2">, the first made on the 9th at the Uriarra pine plantation to protect it from the McIntyre Hut <span class="hook" data-ref="2.6.2.1">fire</span><span class="line closed" id="2.6.2.1"> as it expanded rapidly without direct attack from fire fighters, which was made impossible from poor access and dangerous terrain</span></span>.</span>
          
        <span class="open map"><img src="images/map03.svg"></span>
          
        Throughout the first few days <span class="hook" data-ref="2.7">access</span> remained bad. <span class="line closed" id="2.7">The stockyard Spur fire was particularly bad, and efforts to contain it were largely focussed on creating fire breaks.</span> <span class="hook" data-ref="2.8">Resources</span> were mostly spent on the <span class="hook" data-ref="2.9">Bendora</span> and Gingera fires<span class="line closed" id="2.9">, with controlled burns at Bendora overnight on the weekend</span>. <span class="line closed" id="2.8">A staging ground was established in the Brindabella Mountains.</span>
